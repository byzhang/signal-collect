#summary How to specifiy when a computation is done.

=Automated Convergence Detection=

A computation ends when a computation has converged. Convergence is detected with the `scoreSignal`/`scoreCollect` functions on vertices and the respective `signalThreshold`/`collectThreshold` which are defined globally. The framework will execute `signal`/`collect` operations while the respective scores are above the thresholds. A computation ends when no score is above the respective threshold anymore.

*IMPORTANT:* The framework assumes that the result of `scoreCollect` can only change if:
  * At least one new signal was received
  * Or an outgoing edge was added/removed
  * Or an explicit re-scoring was triggered via `Graph.recalculateScoresForVertexWithId`/`Graph.recalculateScores`

The framework similarly assumes that the result of `scoreSignal` can only change if:
  * The collect operation was executed
  * Or an outgoing edge was added/removed
  * Or an explicit re-scoring was triggered via `Graph.recalculateScoresForVertexWithId`/`Graph.recalculateScores`

These are the default implementations in [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/graph/AbstractVertex.scala AbstractVertex]:

{{{
  def scoreSignal: Double = {
    if (outgoingEdgeAddedSinceSignalOperation) {
      1
    } else {
      lastSignalState match {
        case Some(oldState) if oldState == state => 0
        case noStateOrStateChanged => 1
      }
    }
  }
}}}

The default implementation of the `scoreSignal` function indicates that a vertex should have its edges signal if a new edge was added or if the state has changed.

*IMPORTANT:* Detection of a changed vertex state is by default done with a reference comparison, so if the state reference points to a mutable collection that has changed, no change will be detected! You should in this case either use immutable collections or override the `scoreSignal` function.

The `scoreSignal` function can be overridden with an algorithm-specific implementation, for example to use the residual as a convergence criterium.

{{{
def scoreCollect(signals: Iterable[SignalMessage[_, _, _]]): Double = {
  signals.size
}
}}}

The default implementation of the `scoreCollect` function indicates that a vertex should collect if it has received at least one signal. It can be overridden too, if necessary.
