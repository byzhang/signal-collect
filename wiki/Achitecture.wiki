The Signal/Collect architecture is designed to be easily extensible to a distributed setting. For this purpose much of the complexity of the distributed version will be handled inside the [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/MessageBus.scala MessageBus] implementation, while as much as possible of the high-level computation coordination will be oblivious of the local/distributed setting. There are default implementations for all components, but we also strived to make the design modular such that the concrete [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/MessageBus.scala MessageBus]/[http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Worker.scala Worker]/[http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Storage.scala Storage]/[http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/VertexToWorkerMapper.scala VertexToWorkerMapper] implementations are pluggable.

The following is a description of the default architecture that is instantiated when a graph is created using [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/GraphBuilder.scala GraphBuilder]`.build`. The main API offered to users of Signal/Collect is [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/Graph.scala Graph], which extends [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/GraphEditor.scala GraphEditor]. The implementation created by [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/GraphBuilder.scala GraphBuilder] is of type [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/graph/DefaultGraph.scala DefaultGraph].

[http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/graph/DefaultGraph.scala DefaultGraph] delegates [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/GraphEditor.scala GraphEditor] calls to an instance of [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/graph/DefaultGraphEditor.scala DefaultGraphEditor] and execution/aggregation related calls to an instance of [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/coordinator/Coordinator.scala Coordinator].

[http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/coordinator/Coordinator.scala Coordinator] in turn coordinates computations by controlling workers using the [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/coordinator/WorkerApi.scala WorkerApi], which has a [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/coordinator/WorkerProxy.scala WorkerProxy] instance for each worker. [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/coordinator/WorkerProxy.scala WorkerProxy] implements [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Worker.scala Worker] by doing remote procedure calls over the [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/MessageBus.scala MessageBus] implementation [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/messaging/DefaultMessageBus.scala DefaultMessageBus].

The [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Worker.scala Worker] instances (by default of type [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/worker/LocalWorker.scala LocalWorker]) receive requests via the [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/MessageBus.scala MessageBus] implementation. Some worker requests will initiate a reply from the worker, but this is entirely specified within the [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Messages.scala WorkerRequest], the worker is oblivious to the communication protocol used.

The instance of [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Worker.scala Worker] itself stores instances of [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/Vertex.scala Vertex] in its [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/interfaces/Storage.scala Storage], which by default is of type [http://code.google.com/p/signal-collect/source/browse/trunk/core/src/main/scala/com/signalcollect/implementations/storage/InMemoryStorage.scala InMemoryStorage].
