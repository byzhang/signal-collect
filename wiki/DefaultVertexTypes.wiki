#summary Which vertex implementation to use

= Default Implementations =
*In any Signal/Collect graph different vertices and edges can be freely combined. Usually a vertex is implemented by extending one of the default vertex implementations and an edge is implemented by extending `DefaultEdge`.*

Signal/Collect has two different default vertex implementations:
  * *DataGraphVertex* is suitable for algorithms that iteratively update state associated with vertices and edges.
  * *DataFlowVertex* is suitable for dataflow computations where data is routed through a network of processing vertices. For the user the main noticeable difference is how received signals are submitted to the collect function.

==DataGraphVertex==
In most iterative computations old values get overridden by newer ones . This is why the `collect` function of DataGraphVertex receives signals as a parameter `mostRecentSignals` which contains only the most recently received signal for each incoming edge that has received at least one signal already.

==DataFlowVertex==
In a dataflow computation no signal should ever be lost. This is why the `collect` function of DataFlowVertex receives a parameter `uncollectedSignals` which contains all the signals that have been received along any incoming edge since the collect operation was last executed. The signals are ordered by their time of arrival, oldest signals first. Also the vertex state is supposed to hold the processed elements is automatically reset to a customizable `resetState` whenever the edges are done with signaling.
